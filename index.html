            <p>2014 DataWeek Hackathon Winner!</p>
            <p>Keynobi uses the HP IDOL OnDemand facial recognition API as authentication for password management. The application includes a web application and a Google Chrome extension; users may manage their login information via the web application and use the Chrome extension to log into websites, all using facial recognition via a computer's webcam. The IDOL OnDemand API is not yet available for public use.</p>

            <h2>Simplicity</h2>
            <p>This project emulates a rubegoldberg machine, or series or random complex events to do something simple such as telling the time. We used a sinatra framework and had a master controller that plugged in JavaScript modules after a certain amount of time. The website also connected to a Wemo to bring the Rube Goldberg website into reality so you might not get the whole effect. I was responsible for the 3D cube module and the webcam photos module as well as the simple index page design.</p>

            <h2>DBC Space Invaders</h2>
            <p>With Jeff Kynaston as the team lead, we created a Space Invaders clone. It was built in 10 hours at a Dev Bootcamp hackathon. I was on the team that created the front-end design of the game. It was a close second place.</p>

            <h2>Sunday Adventure</h2>
            <p>Dev Bootcamp hackathon winner. Have you ever wondered what you could do on a Sunday? We created this app so that you had to go to the event to get a new event to force you to try new things. With James Hulley as team lead, Sunday Adventure was built in 10 hours. I helped with front-end design and user experience.</p>
